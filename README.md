Private Dancer
======

Hey nerd, when was the last time you went surfing for that dance?

Or how would you like to see a robot challenge your moves on that favorite track of yours?

Take Me to the Dance Floor!

Private Dancer builds upon the incredible work by 0xFE [here][2].

History
-------
I just woke up the other day and wanted a program to not only play me some music, but jump to life
and dance for me too! 

I quickly skimmed over the state-of-the-art in WebAudio [here][3], and after meeting frustration
trying to make my dancer work alongside the fft code [here][4], I found 0xFE's project, and though
it was limiting to webkit, it offered the missing link I wanted.

Probably someone has done this kind of thing elsewhere before, but hell, it was a thrill building mine too ;-)
Fork and let's get these bits grooving...
